#Surf Up

I decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decided to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that I took to accomplish this task.

##Steps
I used the hawaii database to query the 9 weather stations and precipoitation data over the years.
There is a notebook climate_analysis that has the code for my analysis.
I produced 2 graphs shown below. The first one is of the precipitation and the second one is a histogram of the temperature.

I also built a little web page where you can query the data and get the results in a json file.
